*This is a quick and simple recipe to roast pumpkin seeds.*

Pumpkin carving season just ended so you may be wondering what to do with those leftover pumpkin seeds. Not only are they delicious, but they're also packed with nutrients such as magnesium, zinc, and healthy fats. So don't toss them away. Let me show you what I ended up doing with them. 

# Ingredients

- Pumpkin seeds
- Olive oil
- Ground rosemary
- Salt and pepper
- Garlic powder
- Cayenne pepper (or any chili powder depending on your spice tolerance)

# Steps

1\. **Clean and dry the seeds:** Place the seeds in a colander and rinse under cold water to remove the pumpkin pulp. Pat them dry with a paper towel. This helps them crisp up in the oven.

2\. **Season the seeds:** On a baking try, toss the seeds with with olive oil, ground rosemary, salt and pepper, garlic powder and Cayenne pepper powder. You may replace the Cayenne pepper powder with a different type of chili powder depending on your spice tolerance.

3\. **Roast:** Preheat your oven to 325° F (165° C). Spread the seasoned seeds in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Roast for 20-25 minutes, until they're golden brown.

4\. **Cool and Enjoy:** Let the seeds cool. This will ensure they will crisp up a little more. 

Finally, sit in front of your favorite Fall movie and enjoy!
