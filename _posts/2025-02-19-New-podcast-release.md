# Behind the scenes

We recently did a recording session at Duke's Bryan Center Studios[^5], which was equipped with everything we needed for our podcast. From brainstorming topics to crafting outlines and doing the actual recording, this project has been a wonderful collaborative and creative journey for our ELI dream team.
