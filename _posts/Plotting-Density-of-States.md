*This is a tutorial on plotting Partial Density of States for VASP DFT calculations using a script I wrote a couple months ago where I had to perform the calculation for hundreds of different structural configurations.*

As a *computational* condensed matter physicist who doesnâ€™t require a lab to do research, has COVID-19 affected my work. The answer is YES.
