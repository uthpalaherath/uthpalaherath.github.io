	abstract = {Halide perovskites, with prototype cubic phase {ABX}3, undergo various phase transitions accompanied by rigid rotations of corner-sharing {BX}6 octahedra. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we have performed a comprehensive investigation of all the possible octahedral tilting in eighteen halide perovskites {ABX}3 (A = Cs, Rb, K; B= Pb, Sn; X= I, Br, Cl) and found that the stabilization energies i.e. energy differences between cubic and the most stable tilted phases, are linearly correlated with tolerance factor t. Moreover, the tilt energies i.e. energy differences between cubic and various tilted phases, are linearly correlated with the change of atomic packing fractions (\{{\textbackslash}Delta\}\{{\textbackslash}eta\}), confirming the importance of atomic packing fraction as part of stability descriptor (t+\{{\textbackslash}mu\})\{{\textbackslash}eta\}, proposed in our previous work [{JACS} 139, 14905 (2017)]. We further demonstrate that (t+\{{\textbackslash}mu\})\{{\textbackslash}eta\}remains the best stability descriptor for tilted perovskites among descriptor candidates of \{{\textbackslash}eta\}, \{{\textbackslash}mu\}, t, and t+\{{\textbackslash}mu\},extending previously proposed stability trend from cubic phases to tilted phases in general perovskites.},
