**Hello and welcome!** üëã

I'm Uthpala, a postdoc in the [Ab-Initio Materials Simulations (AIMS)](https://aims.pratt.duke.edu) group at Duke University. As a computational physicist, I currently focus on developing computational methods and frameworks to design, discover and characterize novel materials.

This website serves as my digital corner in cyberspace where I share insights and musings about my [research](/research) and other interests through my [blog](/year-archive). You can explore a list of my [publications](/publications/) derived from my research endeavors and a portfolio of [projects](/projects) I have contributed to. For an in-depth overview of my professional journey, please refer to my [resume](/resume/).
