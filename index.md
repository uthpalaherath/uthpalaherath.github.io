**Hello and welcome!** üëã

I'm Uthpala, a postdoc in the [Ab-Initio Materials Simulations (AIMS)](https://aims.pratt.duke.edu) group at Duke University. My work focuses on developing computational methods and tools to design and characterize novel materials, which have broad applications ranging from advancing semiconductor technologies to enhancing renewable energy solutions.

This website serves as my digital corner in cyberspace where I share insights and musings about my research and personal interests through my [blog](/year-archive). You can explore a list of my [publications](/publications/) derived from my research endeavors and a comprehensive portfolio of [projects](/projects) I have developed or contributed to. For an in-depth overview of my professional journey, please refer to my [resume](/resume/). Check out the [about](/about/) page for a more personal glimpse into my life and passions.

I invite you to browse, read, and interact. Whether it's a thoughtful comment on a blog post or a question about my research, I would love to hear from you!
