Hello and welcome to my personal website!

I am a Postdoctral Associate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science (MEMS) at Duke University in the research group of [Dr. Volker Blum](https://aims.pratt.duke.edu). My current [research](/research/) primarily focuses on developing computational methods and tools to study materials useful in novel semiconductor and renewable energy applications.

During my time as a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at West Virginia University working with [Dr. Aldo Romero](https://physics.wvu.edu/directory/faculty/aldo-romero), my [research](/research/) focused on the study of Strongly Correlated Materials (SCMs) using beyond Density Functional Theory (DFT) quantum many body methods including Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). I was also involved in code development [projects](/projects/) that facilitate pre and post-processing of electronic structure calculations.

Listed here are [publications](/publications/) stemming from my research. For more information about my background please refer to my [CV](/resume/).

Additionally, I maintain a [blog](/year-archive/) on my website relating to my research interests and other topics.
