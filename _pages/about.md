I'm a PhD candidate in Computational Condensed Matter Physics under the guidance of Dr. Aldo Romero at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at West Virginia University. 

### About my research

My research focuses on the computational modeling of state-of-the-art novel material using high performance computing. I mainly study a class of materials known as Strongly Correlated Materials (SCM's) using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Quantum Many Body methods including Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) while actively collaborating with experimental groups which perform synthesis of these remarkable materials. I am also involved with code development projects which facilitate the pre and post processing of electronic structure calculations. Read more about my research [here](/research/).

### Previous research

In the first year of grad school I did research on the computational modeling of Earth's radiation belts in which I studied different loss mechanisms of Ring Current ions. Test particle simulations were carried out to quantify cumulative Field Line Curvature (FLC) scattering of Ring Current ions. It was here where I was first introduced to employing high performance computing (HPC) to solve physics problems. 

My bachelor's research project was done in collaboration with the Arthur C. Clark Institute for Modern Technologies- a leading research institute in Sri Lanka, where I was an intern. I did an extensive study of the stellar population in the globular cluster M53 using CCD Photometry techniques including Aperture Photometry and Point Spread Function (PSF) Fitting Photometry to construct a novel Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD) of the cluster, which was in turn utilized to study its stellar population, mainly focusing on Blue Straggler Stars.  

After finishing high school, I volunteered in a research project conducted by the Sri Lanka Department of Agriculture to develop a system for plant disease diagnosis. This would allow farmers around the island to use a software framework to self-diagnose and treat plant diseases. I assisted in computational aspects of this system.

### Teaching experience

I absolutely love teaching! After completing my bachelor's degree from the University of Peradeniya, I was appointed as a TA in the Department of Physics to teach undergraduate physics. This included conducting lab sessions and tutorials.   

In grad school at West Virginia University, I was a TA for Physics 112 in which I conducted lab sessions in Electromagnetism and Optics for STEM undergraduates.  

### A bit about myself

I was born in the tiny tropical island of Sri Lanka. My family moved to the US when I was about three years old so I grew up in Lincoln, NE (Go Cornhuskers!) until we moved back to Sri Lanka. I completed my bachelors degree majoring in physics and minoring in math at the University of Peradeniya. During my undergraduate degree I was involved in a variety of extra curricular activities including the Physics Society, the Astronomy Society, the Ceylon Drama Society and charity organizations.

Growing up I always admired science and its ability to explain how the universe works. So in high school, I took Physics, Pure and Applied Math and Chemistry for the G.C.E. Advanced Level examinations. I also started learning programming which I found intriguing. It was this fascination that later led me to do research in computational physics in grad school. 

I love being outdoors, especially hiking and backpacking. I live in the Wild and Wonderful state of West Virginia with its abundance of rivers and hiking trails that lead to overlooks with majestic views of the Appalacian mountain range. I like reading- books by Dan Brown and Sydney Sheldon are among my favorites. I also play video games ([Witcher 3](https://thewitcher.com/en/) is one the best games ever made!) on my PS4.  As for sports Iâ€™m a fan of [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket) and rugby.
