### Teaching experience

I absolutely love teaching! After completing my bachelor's degree from the University of Peradeniya, I was appointed as a TA in the Department of Physics to teach undergraduate physics. This included conducting lab sessions and tutorials.   

In grad school at West Virginia University, I was a TA for Physics 112 in which I conducted lab sessions in Electromagnetism and Optics for STEM undergraduates.  

### A bit about myself

I was born in the tiny tropical island of Sri Lanka. My family moved to the US when I was about three years old so I grew up in Lincoln, NE (Go Cornhuskers!) until we moved back to Sri Lanka. I completed my bachelors degree majoring in physics and minoring in math at the University of Peradeniya. During my undergraduate degree I was involved in a variety of extra curricular activities including the Physics Society, the Astronomy Society, the Ceylon Drama Society and charity organizations.

Growing up I always admired science and its ability to explain how the universe works. So in high school, I took Physics, Pure and Applied Math and Chemistry for the G.C.E. Advanced Level examinations. I also started learning programming which I found intriguing. It was this fascination that later led me to do research in computational physics in grad school. 

I love being outdoors, especially hiking and backpacking. I live in the Wild and Wonderful state of West Virginia with its abundance of rivers and hiking trails that lead to overlooks with majestic views of the Appalacian mountain range. I like reading- books by Dan Brown and Sydney Sheldon are among my favorites. I also play video games ([Witcher 3](https://thewitcher.com/en/) is one the best games ever made!) on my PS4.  As for sports Iâ€™m a fan of [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket) and rugby.
