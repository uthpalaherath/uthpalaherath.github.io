### Research Experience

Please visit my [research](/research/) page for more details.<br />

- **Graduate Research Assistant (Computational Materials Science): 2017 - current**<br />Department of Physics and Astronomy, West Virginia University
  - The study of strongly correlated materials using beyond-DFT methods such as Dynamical Mean Field Theory.
  - Studied the effect of oxygen vacancies in strongly correlated rare earth nickelates using DFT+DMFT.
  - Studied alloying/defects in strongly correlated materials using virtual crystal approximation within DMFT.
  - Development of DMFTwDFT; an open-source, user-friendly framework to calculate electronic, vibrational and elastic properties in strongly correlated materials (SCM) using beyond-DFT methods such as DFT+U, DFT+Hybrids and DFT+DMFT (Dynamical Mean Field Theory) with a variety of different DFT codes.
  - Development of PyProcar; a robust, open-source Python library used for pre- and post-processing of the electronic structure data coming from DFT calculations.
- **Graduate Research Assistant (Computational Space Physics): 2016-2017**<br />Department of Physics and Astronomy, West Virginia University
  - *"The effect of magnetic field line curvature scattering on the rapid loss of ring current ions"*<br />Performed test particle simulations to quantify cumulative FLC scattering of ring current ions. Based on thesesimulation results, a physical parameterization for the FLC scattering is determined which is incorporated intothe RAM-SCB model
- **Intern (Space Applications Division): 2014** <br />Arthur C. Clarke Institute of Modern Technologies, Sri Lanka
  - Project: *"Identification of Blue Stragglers in the globular cluster M53 using CCD photometry"*
  - Worked in conjunction with an expert team of scientists at the Space Applications division of ACCIMT toperform an extensive study of globular cluster characteristics using Aperture Photometry and PSF (PointSpread Function) Fitting Photometry methods with the IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility) system.
  - Telescopic data of the globular cluster M53 was used to construct a novel Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD) ofthe cluster, which was in turn utilized to study its stellar population, mainly focusing on the Blue Straggler Starpopulation.
- **Undergraduate Researcher: 2012-2013**<br />University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka 
  - Research Project: *“Nano Magnets and their Applications”*<br />The traits, synthesis methods, functionalization and applications of Nano Magnets were investigated.

### A bit about myself

I was born in the tiny tropical island of Sri Lanka. My family moved to the US when I was about three years old so I grew up in Lincoln, NE (Go Cornhuskers!) until we moved back to Sri Lanka. I completed my bachelors degree majoring in physics and minoring in math at the University of Peradeniya. During my undergraduate degree I was involved in a variety of extra curricular activities including the Physics Society, the Astronomy Society, the Ceylon Drama Society and charity organizations.

Growing up I always admired science and its ability to explain how the universe works. So in high school, I took Physics, Pure and Applied Math and Chemistry for the G.C.E. Advanced Level examinations. I also started learning programming which I found intriguing. It was this fascination that later led me to do research in computational physics in grad school. 

I love being outdoors, especially hiking and backpacking. I live in the Wild and Wonderful state of West Virginia with its abundance of rivers and hiking trails that lead to overlooks with majestic views of the Appalacian mountain range. I like reading- books by Dan Brown and Sydney Sheldon are among my favorites. I also play video games ([Witcher 3](https://thewitcher.com/en/) is one the best games ever made!) on my PS4.  As for sports I’m a fan of [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket) and rugby.
