Hi! My name is Uthpala and I'm originally from the tiny tropical island of Sri Lanka. I'm currently a PhD candidate in Computational Condensed Matter Physics in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at West Virginia University. 

My research focuses on the computational modeling of state-of-the-art novel material using high performance computing. I mainly study a class of materials known as Strongly Correlated Materials (SCM's) using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Quantum Many Body methods including GW and Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) while actively collaborating with experimental groups which perform synthesis of these remarkable materials. I am also involved with code development projects which facilitate the pre and post processing of electronic structure calculations. 

Thanks for visiting my blog!
