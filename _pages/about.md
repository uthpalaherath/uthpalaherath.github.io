- **Graduate Research Assistant (Computational Materials Science) : 2017 - current**<br />Romero Group <br />Department of Physics and Astronomy, West Virginia University
  
  - Strongly Correlated Materials Research
    
    - Developed the DMFTwDFT framework; an open-source, user-friendly framework to calculate electronic, vibrational and elastic properties in strongly correlated materials (SCMs) using DMFT (Dynamical Mean Field Theory) in combination with a variety of DFT codes including VASP, Siesta and Quantum Espresso interfaced through Maximally Localized Wannier Functions (MLWF) and a Continuous Time Quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) impurity solver. Based on the original implementation by Dr. Hyowon Park at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Additionally, maintained the code repository and community forum.
    - Implemented full charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT calculations within the DMFTwDFT framework for the DFT code Siesta in collaboration with Dr. Javier Junquera, a lead developer for Siesta.
    - Performed electronic structure calculations to study the electronic properties of transition and rare-earth correlated nickelate perovskites using DMFTwDFT.
    - Carried out molecular dynamics simulations on SCMs using our in-house MDWC code.
    - Studied the effect of symmetrically induced oxygen vacancies based on site occupation disorder in strongly correlated rare earth nickelate perovskites using a combination of DFT and DMFT and identified potential metal-to-insulator transitions. Further studied the minimum energy pathways for oxygen vacancy diffusion using Nudged Elastic Band theory (NEB) within DMFT for these vacancies.
    - Investigated the electronic properties of strongly correlated oxynitrides perovskites and Heusler alloys.
    - Applied virtual crystal approximation (VCA) within DMFT to study alloying/ defects in SCMs.
    
  - Contribution to materials research frameworks
  
    - Development of PyProcar; a robust, open-source Python library used for pre- and post-processing of theelectronic structure data coming from DFT calculations. Based on the original implementation by Dr. Aldo Romero and Dr. Francisco Muñoz. Additionally, maintained the code repository and community forum for the project.
    - Contributed to MechElastic; An open-source Python library to calculate elastic properties of materials. Implemented the Equation of State analysis and Abinit interface along with pressure corrections in VASP. Maintained the code repository and the community forum. Original implementation by Dr. Sobhit Singh.
    - Contributed to MDWC; our in-house command line open-source Python program for constrained molecular dynamics simulations. Involved in debugging and post-processing tool development. Based on the implementation by Dr. Arturo Hernandez.

    - Worked in conjunction with an expert team of scientists at the Space Applications division of ACCIMT toperform an extensive study of globular cluster characteristics using Aperture Photometry and PSF (PointSpread Function) Fitting Photometry methods with the IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility) system.
    - Telescopic data of the globular cluster M53 was used to construct a novel Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD) of the cluster, which was in turn utilized to study its stellar population, mainly focusing on the Blue Straggler Star population.

### A bit about myself

I was born in the tiny tropical island of Sri Lanka. My family moved to the US when I was about three years old so I grew up in Lincoln, NE (Go Cornhuskers!) until we moved back to Sri Lanka. I completed my bachelors degree majoring in physics and minoring in math at the University of Peradeniya. During my undergraduate degree I was involved in a variety of extra curricular activities including the Physics Society, the Astronomy Society, the Ceylon Drama Society and charity organizations.

Growing up I always admired science and its ability to explain how the universe works. So in high school, I took Physics, Pure and Applied Math and Chemistry for the G.C.E. Advanced Level examinations. I also started learning programming which I found intriguing. It was this fascination that later led me to do research in computational physics in grad school. 

I love being outdoors, especially hiking and backpacking. I live in the Wild and Wonderful state of West Virginia with its abundance of rivers and hiking trails that lead to overlooks with majestic views of the Appalacian mountain range. I like reading- books by Dan Brown and Sydney Sheldon are among my favorites. I also play video games ([Witcher 3](https://thewitcher.com/en/) is one the best games ever made!) on my PS4.  As for sports I’m a fan of [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket) and rugby.
