I'm currently a PhD candidate in Computational Condensed Matter Physics under the guidance of Dr. Aldo Romero at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at West Virginia University.

### About my research

My research focuses on the computational modeling of state-of-the-art novel material using high performance computing. I mainly study a class of materials known as Strongly Correlated Materials (SCM's) using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Quantum Many Body methods including Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) while actively collaborating with experimental groups which perform synthesis of these remarkable materials. I am also involved with code development projects which facilitate the pre and post processing of electronic structure calculations. 

More details about my research can be found [here](/research/).

### Previous research

Before I started research in condensed matter physics, I was in a research group that performed computational modeling of Earth's radiation belts in which I studied different loss mechanisms of Ring Current ions. It was here where I was first introduced to employing high performance computing (HPC) to solve physics problems. You can find more info on that [here](/presentations/).
