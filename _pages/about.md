Hello! I'm Uthpala, a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science (MEMS) at Duke University. I work with [Dr. Volker Blum's](https://aims.pratt.duke.edu) research group, exploring the fascinating intersection of materials science and computational physics.

## My journey

Born on the tropical island of Sri Lanka, I moved to the United States at the age of three and grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska. My family later returned to Sri Lanka, where my passion for science truly took root. In high school, I immersed myself in Physics, Pure and Applied Mathematics, and Chemistry for the G.C.E. Advanced Level examinations. It was during this time I discovered a love for programming, which sparked my interest in computational physics.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Physics with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka. During my undergraduate years, I was actively involved in the Physics Society, the Astronomy Society, the Ceylon Drama Society, and various charity organizations.  I also volunteered in a research project with the Sri Lanka Department of Agriculture, assisting in the development of a computational system for plant disease diagnosis to help farmers across the country.

To further pursue my research interests, I returned to the US for graduate studies, earning my Ph.D. in Physics at West Virginia University under the mentorship of [Dr. Aldo Romero](https://aldoromero.sandbox.wvu.edu). As a graduate student, I was an active member in the Physics and Astronomy Graduate Student Organization (PAGSO) and contributed to physics outreach programs to enhance public literacy in science across West Virginia.

At Duke University, I continue to contribute to advancements in materials science, collaborating with a diverse team of researchers. Beyond research, I serve on the council of the [Duke Postdoctoral Association (DUPA)](https://dukepostdocs.org) where I help organize events that bring together postdocs from diverse backgrounds.

## Life beyond academia

When I'm not in the lab, you can find me exploring the great outdoors. I love hiking, backpacking, and camping—activities that allow me to connect with nature. My time in the "Wild and Wonderful" state of West Virginia was filled with adventures along its rivers and trails, offering breathtaking views of the Appalachian Mountains. Now based in North Carolina, I continue to enjoy its equally stunning landscapes.

In my spare time, I'm an avid reader—feel free to check out my [Goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62553916-uthpala-herath). I'm also a fan of cricket and rugby, and recently, I've taken up stand-up paddleboarding to challenge myself in new ways.
