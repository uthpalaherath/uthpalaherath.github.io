<p>Hello and welcome to my personal website!</p>

<p> I am a Postdoctral Associate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science (MEMS) at Duke University in the research group of <a href="https://aims.pratt.duke.edu" style="text-decoration: none;">Dr. Volker Blum</a>. My current <a href="https://uthpalaherath.github.io/research/" style="text-decoration: none;">research</a> primarily focuses on developing computational methods and tools to study materials useful in novel semiconductor and renewable energy applications.
</p>

<p>During my time as a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at West Virginia University working with <a href="https://physics.wvu.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty/aldo-romero" style="text-decoration: none;">Dr. Aldo Romero</a>, my <a href="https://uthpalaherath.github.io/research/" style="text-decoration: none;">research</a>  focused on the study of Strongly Correlated Materials (SCMs) using beyond Density Functional Theory (DFT) quantum many body methods including Dynamical
Mean Field Theory (DMFT). I was also involved in  <a href="https://uthpalaherath.github.io/projects/" style="text-decoration: none;">code development projects</a> that facilitate pre and post-processing of electronic structure calculations.</p>

<p>Listed here are <a href="https://uthpalaherath.github.io/publications/" style="text-decoration: none;">publications</a> stemming from my research. For more information about my background please refer to my <a href="https://uthpalaherath.github.io/resume/" style="text-decoration: none;">CV</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, I maintain a <a href="https://uthpalaherath.github.io/year-archive/" style="text-decoration: none;">blog</a> on my website relating to my research interests and other topics.</p>
