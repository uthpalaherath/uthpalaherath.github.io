Hello and welcome to my personal website. <br> 
I am currently a PhD candidate in the group of <a href="https://physics.wvu.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty/aldo-romero">Dr. Aldo Romero</a>  at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at West Virginia University. My <a href="https://uthpalaherath.github.io/research/">research</a>  primarily focuses on the study of Strongly Correlated Materials (SCMs) that display intriguing properties using beyond Density Functional Theory (DFT) quantum many body methods including Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). I am also involved in  <a href="https://uthpalaherath.github.io/projects/">code development projects</a> that facilitate pre and post-processing of electronic structure calculations. <br> 

Listed here are <a href="https://uthpalaherath.github.io/publications/">publications</a> related to my research. For more details please take a look at my <a href="https://uthpalaherath.github.io/assets/docs/Uthpala-CV.pdf">CV</a>. <br>

Additionally, I maintain a <a href="https://uthpalaherath.github.io/year-archive/">blog</a> about random topics here on my website. 

Please feel free to leave a comment on my posts and if you'd like to contact me drop me an email. Click on the tabs above to learn more about me and my work.
